This will involve, by means of the architectural studio, a reiterative investigation into the relationship of technique, form, and meaning through study, invention, testing, and evaluation. During this semester a series of short problems will be given to expose you to the complexities of visual communication and the design act; to develop skills of spatial manipulation; to give you the self-confidence in making valid decisions within set time limits; to develop the skills of graphic presentation necessary for interpreting and communicating your architectural intentions; and above all, to instill the ability to combine insight with the rigorous analytical study in a design process that is efficient, personally effective, and which becomes second nature to you as a working process.");

The state of the art in building energy conservation and passive heating and cooling technologies will be presented, with take-home readings and assignments.");

Media used are pastels on gray backgrounds, colored pencil on white backgrounds and water color. In the interest of speed the principal technique used in watercolor is a moderate dry brush technique. Coursework assumes knowledge of linear perspective and basic use of color. Work consists of in-class exercises and weekend assignments built on these. Students can expect to spend up to 6 hours of work per weekend.");
